Factors that could influence residential home prices across United States over the next decade.

1. Affordability :
Rising incomes mean that people are able to afford to spend more on housing. During periods of economic growth, demand for houses tends to rise.Also demand for housing tends to be a luxury good. So rise in income causes a bigger % rise in demand.

This graph shows that house prices and therefore demand for housing can rise much faster than earnings, suggesting there are many other factors influencing demand.

From 2019 to 2021, the average house-price-to-income ratio increased from 4.7 to 5.4 a 14.9% increase that's more than double the recommended ratio of 2.6. In other words, homes cost 5.4x what the average person earns in one year.

We can see above that since 1965, average home values showing - 118% increase. Meanwhile median household income crept up just 15%.
Home prices have increased 7.6x faster than income since 1965 and 3.1x faster than income since 2008, accounting for inflation.
To afford a home in 2021, Americans need an average income of  144,192𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 69,178
The current average house-price-to-income ratio means it takes prospective home buyers 5.4 years to save enough to purchase a home. These exorbitant home prices also mean monthly mortgage payments place a major financial strain on homeowners, even if they manage to save enough to purchase a home.
Across the nation, the pandemic accelerated a major divide between home values and income.Though conventional wisdom suggests most home buyers offer 1% to 3% over asking price in competitve markets, low inventory and high demand drove some home buyers to desperate measures. Today,It's not uncommon to hear of people offering far more that the seller's asking price with some even offering $1 million more than the listing price.

2. Confidence:
Demand for houses depends on consumer confidence. In particular, It depends on peopl's confidence about the future of economy. If people expect prices to rise, demand will rise as shown above.
3. Intereset Rates:
Interest rates play a major role in determining the cost of mortgage interest repayments. When interest rates rise, so do mortgage rates. This makes buying a home more expensive. 
Secondly, when inflation is rising, people have to spend more of their income on the daily necessities such as food, petrol and heating. Rising inflation tends to lead to slower house price growth. It can also make harder to get a mortgage. Its good time to sell a house before higher inflation leads to lower activity in property market.

How rising inflation affect housing market ?

You might expect rising inflation means house prices will also rise, but this is not the case. Inflation is something that measures the rate at which the price of key goods and services change over time. When inflation is rising, it means these things are becoming more expensive. There are several different indexes that measure changes to inflation. The key one for the housing market is the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). But houses are not included in the basket of goods used to calculate the CPI. There is a separate index, known as the CPIH (Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers Housing costs). Rising inflation tends to lead to slower house price growth. There are two reasons for this :

- Bank of England's tasks is to keep CPI inflation as close to 2% as possible. So, If inflation rises above this target, the Bank of England may raise interest rates to try to reduce it. This is a major factor in determining the affordability of housing. Mortgage payments take a high % of people's personal disposable income(average is 25% but, for some homeowners it is higher). Therefor, even small changes in interest rates can deter people from buying.

- When Inflation is rising people have to spend more of their income on the daily necessities.
As a result, house price growth tends to slow when inflation is rising.

Historic Interest and Inflation rates: Important years for rates

2008 (Financial Crisis) - Between 2007 and 2008, Interest rates fell from 5.1% to 2.3% in efforts to curtail the subprime mortgage and banking crisis. SOURCE : FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (SEP,2020)

2016 (All time low rates) - Historical trends show that a 'Lower for longer' rate cycle is projected for the future. SOURCE : BANK OF ENGLAND(JAN,2020)

2020 (Coronavirus pandemic) - Inflation rate rise in 2020 and 2021 in response to Coronavirus pandemic.

4.Population:
The average growth range of US population ranges from 0.38% to 0.9% every year. The United States is projected to grow by nearly 79 million people in the next 4 decades, from about 326 million to 404 million between 2017 and 2060. The population is pro- jected to cross the 400-million mark in 2058. Population is a very important factor. It is not just the number of people but demographic changes leads to influence in house prices. e.g. growing number of single people living alone has led to increasing demand for houses. We know if demand increases price will increase.

In above graph we can see that there are 28.46% of households with one person. An average annual rise of single person household is 1.1% over 2015-2030. There were 37 million one-person households in 2021, or 28% of all U.S. households. The number of families with their own children under age 18 in the household declined over the last two decades. The projections show that single-person households are set to reach about 41.4 million by 2030, which will again lead to increase in house prices in US.

The demand for housing doesn't just depend on the population but also the average size of household. We can see above how the average is decreasing since 1960. This shows that certain social and demographic factors are causing a rise in number of households(faster than population) such as:

Increased life expectancy,leading to more single old people
Divorce rates -increasing number of single-parent families.
5.Mortgage rate
Another factor that determines the effective demand for houses is the mortgage rates. Mortgage rates always go lower but you shouldn't expect them to. With inflation at 40-year highs and the Federal Reserve making aggressive rate hikes to combat it, mortgage rates seem likely to rise in the near future. Fed does not set mortgage rate rates, but these rates follow the same general trend as the overall market. When mortgage rates rise, home values fall.

6. Economy and Unemplyment
This graphs shows that economy is recovering and Unemployment is falling.The US economy contracted by 3.5% during 2020, in contrast to an annual growth of 2.2% in 2019 and the biggest decline since the demobilization from World War II in 1956, as the country was ravaged by the global pandemic last year.

In June 2022, the unemployment rate dropped to 3.7%, sharply down from 8.1% a year earlier and from a peak of 14.8% in April 2020 ( due to coronavirus pandemic), according to the U.S. Bureau of labor statistics. Now the unemployment rate is lower than the average unemployment rate 4.4% from 2015 to 2019.

7. Property, Sales and income tax rate
Employment income, as well as business and professional income, is subject to progressive federal income tax rates.
State governments in the U.S. levy their own taxes on income. Non-residents are subject to state income taxes in the state where they earn income. The rates are progressive and very from state to state. The income brackets are mostly the same as, or sometimes modified from the federal income tax brackets.
